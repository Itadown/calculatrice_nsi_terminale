# calculatrice_nsi_terminale
This is my second term project of NSI (a course subject in high school (I don't know if it exist in other countrys or what's the name of this course)), and it's a calculator, i got 21/20 at this project with one friend.

I did a little QR code who is hide with a key combination (and I hide the QR code file too with the "hidden file").
I used tkinter for the graphic interface and pillow for the QR code only. 

I had hidden a snake game too for fun.
