# calculatrice_nsi_terminale
This is my second term project of NSI (a course subject in high school (I don't know if it exist in other countrys or what's the name of this course)), and it's a calculator, i got 21/20 at this project with one friend.

I did a little QR code who is hide with a key combination (and I hide the QR code file too with the "hidden file").
I used tkinter for the graphic interface, pillow for the QR code only and math for some things like pi... 

I had hidden a snake game too for fun.

The instruction was to make a calculator with the reverse Polish method and the Pile class (because we just learn that at this moment), and we add like i said before, a snake, a QR code, but a lot of math function too, and a normal calcul method.
